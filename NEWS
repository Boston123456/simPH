Version 0.03.2

Minor bug fixes, documentation improvements for `coxsimInteract`.


Version 0.03.1

Improved error messages in `coxsimInteract` and minor documentation changes.


Version 0.03

Added `coxsimInteract` to simulate quantities of interest for linear multiplicative interactions and `gginteract` for plotting these simulations.

Also made an important fix to how `coxsimLinear` calculates hazard rates and how `gglinear` plots these simulations.

Other documentation fixes.


Version 0.02.2

Minor change to how `coxsimtvc` runs so that it is no longer dependent on **reshape**.


Version 0.02.1

Updated documentation and added the ability to change the smoothing line colour for first difference and relative hazard plots.

Version 0.02

Added functions for simulating and plotting linear non-time-varying hazards. 

- `coxsimLinear`: simulates linear non-time-varying hazards

- `gglinear`: plots linear non-time-varying-hazards

Version 0.01

First version, largely ported from simtvc version 0.04 (<http://christophergandrud.github.com/simtvc/>), with the addition of the ability to work with polynomials. This includes two functions

- `coxsimPoly` simulates polynomial relative hazards

- `ggpoly` graphs the simulated polynomial relative hazards
