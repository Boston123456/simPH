Package: simPH
Title: Tools for simulating and graphing quantities of interest estimated using
    Cox Proportional Hazards models.
Description: The package simulates and plots quantities of interest (relative
    hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios)for linear coefficients,
    multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines, and
    non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survial curves from Cox
    Proportional Hazard models.
